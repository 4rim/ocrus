# ocrus

Aka OC-R-US (haha get it)\

Simple Python script that takes in images (screenshots of text) and uses
Tesseract OCR to spit out recognizable text. The text is then parsed for
several things including but not limited to:\

- Creates word frequency list
- Matches words with Anki flashcard files
- Allows for quick dictionary look-ups

Currently this project focuses on Russian, since I'm learning it.
